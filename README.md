# Unsupervised-Learning-of-Data-with-High-Morphology-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
We propose Morpho-GAN, a method that unifies several GAN techniques to generate quality data of high morphology. Our method introduces a new suitable training objective in the discriminator of GAN to synthesize images that follow the distribution of the original dataset. 

Code accompanying our [Dist-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08887) and [GN-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01333) (update soon) papers.

## Setup

### Dependencies
Python 2.7 or 3.x, Numpy, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras (1D demo) <br>
For Python 3.x - `import pickle` in the file `distgan_image/modules/dataset.py`

### Getting Started
We conduct experiments of our model with 1D/2D synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.

#### 1D demo
In addition to Dist-GAN, other methods, such as GAN, MDGAN, VAEGAN, WGAN-GP are provided in our 1D code.

```
>> cd distgan_toy1d
>> python gan_toy1d.py
```

Quick video demos, you can reproduce easily these videos with our code:

[WGANGP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MDBwdfD5rY) (WGAN-GP can match data distribution at some time, but diverged later) <br>
[VAEGAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=587z8VBcvvQ) <br>
[Dist-GAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjbdMNo4m_8) <br>

The visualization part of our 1D code is re-used from [here](https://github.com/kremerj/gan):

#### 2D synthetic data
```
>> cd distgan_toy2d
>> python distgan_toy2d.py
```

We provide three different data layouts you can test on: 'SINE' 'PLUS' 'SQUARE'. Just change the parameter `testcase` in the code `gaan_toy2d.py`. For example:
```
testcase      = 'SQUARE'
```

#### Image data (MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10)

We provide our code for image datasets, such as: MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10.

##### MNIST

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_mnist.py
```

![Real samples](./distgan_image/images/mnist_100000_real.jpg)

From left to right: Samples generated by our Dist-GAN model (DCGAN for MNIST) and real samples.

##### CIFAR-10
Downloading cifar-10 from 'http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz' and extracting it into the correct folder: eg. `./data/cifar10/`

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_cifar.py
```

![Generated samples](./distgan_image/images/cifar_100000_fake.jpg)
![Real samples](./distgan_image/images/cifar_100000_real.jpg)

##### CelebA
Downloading CelebA from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg and extract into the correct folder: eg. `./data/celeba/`

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_celeba.py
```

![Generated samples](./distgan_image/images/celeba_25100_fake.jpg)
![Real samples](./distgan_image/images/celeba_100000_real.jpg)

From left to right: Samples generated by our Dist-GAN model (DCGAN) and real samples.

##### STL-10
Downloading STL-10 from: http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_binary.tar.gz and extract it into a folder. Then, using `./modules/create_stl10.py` to read binary file `unlabeled_X.bin` and save images into a specific folder: eg. `./data/stl-10/`

```
>> cd distgan_image
>> python distgan_stl10.py
```

Generated samples are generated into a folder as `./morphogan_image/images/galaxyzoo_{}_fake.jpg`<br>
Real samples are generated into a folder as `./morphogan_image/images/galaxyzoo_{}_real.jpg`
