# Unsupervised-Learning-of-Data-with-High-Morphology-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
We propose Morpho-GAN, a method that unifies several GAN techniques to generate quality data of high morphology. Our method introduces a new suitable training objective in the discriminator of GAN to synthesize images that follow the distribution of the original dataset.
